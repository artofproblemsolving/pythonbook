<h1>Contributor List<a class="headerlink" href="#contributor-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To paraphrase the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation, this book is free
like free speech, but not necessarily free like free pizza. It came about
because of a collaboration that would not have been possible without the GNU
Free Documentation License. So we would like to thank the Free Software
Foundation for developing this license and, of course, making it available to
us.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank the more than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers
who have sent us suggestions and corrections over the past few years. In the
spirit of free software, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a
contributor list.  Unfortunately, this list is not complete, but we are doing
our best to keep it up to date. It was also getting too large to include
everyone who sends in a typo or two. You have our gratitude, and you have the
personal satisfaction of making a book you found useful better for you and
everyone else who uses it. New additions to the list for the 2nd edition will
be those who have made on-going contributions.</p>
<p>If you have a chance to look through the list, you should realize that each
person here has spared you and all subsequent readers from the confusion of a
technical error or a less-than-transparent explanation, just by sending us a
note.</p>
<p>Impossible as it may seem after so many corrections, there may still be errors
in this book. If you should stumble across one, we hope you will take a minute
to contact us. The email address (for the Python 3 version of the book)
is <a class="reference external" href="mailto:p&#46;wentworth&#37;&#52;&#48;ru&#46;ac&#46;za">p<span>&#46;</span>wentworth<span>&#64;</span>ru<span>&#46;</span>ac<span>&#46;</span>za</a>
. Substantial changes made due to your suggestions will add you to the next
version of the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). Thank you!</p>

<h2>Second Edition<a class="headerlink" href="#second-edition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An email from Mike MacHenry set me straight on tail recursion. He not only
pointed out an error in the presentation, but suggested how to correct it.</li>
<li>It wasn&#8217;t until 5th Grade student Owen Davies came to me in a Saturday
morning Python enrichment class and said he wanted to write the card game,
Gin Rummy, in Python that I finally knew what I wanted to use as the case
study for the object oriented programming chapters.</li>
<li>A <em>special</em> thanks to pioneering students in Jeff&#8217;s Python Programming class
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arlington.k12.va.us/1540108115320583/blank/browse.asp?A=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;C=59085">GCTAA</a> during the 2009-2010 school year: Safath
Ahmed, Howard Batiste, Louis Elkner-Alfaro, and Rachel Hancock.  Your
continual and thoughtfull feedback led to changes in most of the chapters of
the book.  You set the standard for the active and engaged learners that will
help make the new Governor&#8217;s Academy what it is to become.  Thanks to you
this is truly a <em>student tested</em> text.</li>
<li>Thanks in a similar vein to the students in Jeff&#8217;s Computer Science
class at the HB-Woodlawn program during the 2007-2008 school year: James
Crowley, Joshua Eddy, Eric Larson, Brian McGrail, and Iliana Vazuka.</li>

<li>Michael Vogt reported an indentation error in an example in chapter 6, and
sent in a suggestion for improving the clarity of the shell vs.  script
section in chapter 1.</li>
