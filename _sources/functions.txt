Functions
=========

Functions
---------
      
     
In Python, a **function** is a named sequence of statements
that belong together.  Their primary purpose is to help us
organize programs into chunks that match how we think about
the problem. 
 
The syntax for a **function definition** is:

.. activecode:: functiondef
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   def NAME( PARAMETERS ):
       STATEMENTS

We can make up any names we want for the functions we create, except that
we can't use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules
for legal identifiers. By convention, we like to use all lowercase for function names,
with words separated by underscores, such as ``draw_square``. 

There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be
indented from the ``def``. In the examples in this book, we will use the
standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of
several **compound statements** we will see, all of which have the same
pattern:

#. A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.
#. A **body** consisting of one or more Python statements, each
   indented the same amount --- we strongly recommend 4 spaces --- from
   the header line.

We've already seen the ``for`` loop which follows this pattern.
   
So looking again at the function definition, the keyword in the header is ``def``, which is
followed by the name of the function and some *parameters* enclosed in
parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of
parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.
The parameters specifies what information, if any, we have to provide in order to use the new function.

Suppose we're working with turtles, and a common operation we need is to draw
squares.   "Draw a square" is an *abstraction*, or a mental
chunk, of a number of smaller steps.  So let's write a function to capture the pattern
of this "building block": 

.. activecode:: drawsquarefunc

   import turtle 

   def draw_square(t, sz):
       """Make turtle t draw a square of sz."""            
       for i in range(4):
           t.forward(sz)             
           t.left(90)
    
   wn = turtle.Screen()        # Set up the window and its attributes
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
   wn.title("Alex meets a function")

   alex = turtle.Turtle()      # Create alex
   draw_square(alex, 50)       # Call the function to draw the square

   wn.mainloop()

        
This function is named ``draw_square``.  It has two parameters: one to tell 
the function which turtle to move around, and the other to tell it the size
of the square we want drawn.   Make sure you know where the body of the function
ends --- it depends on the indentation, and the blank lines don't count for
this purpose!   

.. admonition::  Docstrings for documentation

    If the first thing after the function header is a string, it is
    treated as a **docstring** and gets special treatment in Python and
    in some programming tools. For example, when we when we type ``help('funcname')``
    in the IDLE shell (where "funcname" is the name of the function), we get a message telling us what arguments the function takes, and it shows 
    us any other text contained in the docstring. For example, type ``help('print')``
    in the IDLE shell and read the message that you get.

    Docstrings are the key way to document our functions in Python and
    the documentation part is important. Because whoever calls our
    function shouldn't have to need to know what is going on in the
    function or how it works; they just need to know what arguments our
    function takes, what it does, and what the expected result is.
    Enough to be able to use the function without having to look
    underneath. This goes back to the concept of abstraction of which
    we'll talk more about.

    Docstrings are usually formed using triple-quoted strings as they
    allow us to easily expand the docstring later on should we want to
    write more than a one-liner.

    Just to differentiate from comments, a string at the start of a
    function (a docstring) is retrievable by Python tools *at runtime*.
    By contrast, comments are completely eliminated when the program is 
    parsed.  
 

Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a
**function call**. We've already seen how to call some built-in functions like
**print**, **range** and **int**. Function calls contain the name of the function being
executed followed by a list of values, called *arguments*, which are assigned
to the parameters in the function definition.  So in line 14 of the program above, we call the function, and pass ``alex`` as the turtle to be manipulated,
and 50 as the size of the square we want. While the function is executing, then, the 
variable ``sz`` refers to the value 50, and the variable ``t`` refers to the same
turtle instance that the variable ``alex`` refers to. 

Once we've defined a function, we can call it as often as we like, and its 
statements will be executed each time we call it.  And we could use it to get
any of our turtles to draw a square.   In the next example, we've changed the ``draw_square``
function a little, and we get tess to draw 15 squares, with some variations.

.. activecode:: drawmultisquare
   :cheight: 500
   :cwidth: 500

   import turtle

   def draw_multicolor_square(t, sz):  
       """Make turtle t draw a multi-color square of sz."""
       for i in ["red", "purple", "hotpink", "blue"]:
           t.color(i)
           t.forward(sz)
           t.left(90)

   wn = turtle.Screen()        # Set up the window and its attributes
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

   tess = turtle.Turtle()      # Create tess and set some attributes
   tess.pensize(3)

   size = 20                   # Size of the smallest square
   for i in range(15):
       draw_multicolor_square(tess, size)
       size = size + 10        # Increase the size for next time
       tess.forward(10)        # Move tess along a little
       tess.right(18)          #    and give her some turn

   wn.mainloop()

Functions can call other functions
----------------------------------

Let's assume now we want a function to draw a rectangle.  We need to be able to call
the function with different arguments for width and height.  And, unlike the case of the
square, we cannot repeat the same thing 4 times, because the four sides are not equal.

So we eventually come up with this rather nice code that can draw a rectangle.

.. activecode:: rectangleexample
   :norun:
   :nolinenums:

   def draw_rectangle(t, w, h):
       """Get turtle t to draw a rectangle of width w and height h."""
       for i in range(2):
           t.forward(w)
           t.left(90)
           t.forward(h)
           t.left(90)
            
The parameter names are deliberately chosen as single letters to ensure they're not misunderstood.
In real programs, once we've had more experience, we will insist on better variable names than this.
But the point is that the program doesn't "understand" that we're drawing a rectangle, or that the
parameters represent the width and the height.  Concepts like rectangle, width, and height are 
the meaning we humans have, not concepts that the program or the computer understands.    

*Thinking like a computer scientist* involves looking for patterns and 
relationships.  In the code above, we've done that to some extent.  We did not just draw four sides.
Instead, we spotted that we could draw the rectangle as two halves, and used a loop to
repeat that pattern twice.

But now we might spot that a square is a special kind of rectangle.
We already have a function that draws a rectangle, so we can use that to draw
our square. 

.. activecode:: squareexample
   :norun:
   :nolinenums:

   def draw_square(tx, sz):        # A new version of draw_square
       draw_rectangle(tx, sz, sz)

There are some points worth noting here:

* Functions can call other functions.
* Rewriting ``draw_square`` like this captures the relationship
  that we've spotted between squares and rectangles.  
* A caller of this function might say ``draw_square(tess, 50)``.  The parameters
  of this function, ``tx`` and ``sz``, are assigned the values of the tess object, and
  the int 50 respectively.
* In the body of the function they are just like any other variable. 
* When the call is made to ``draw_rectangle``, the values in variables ``tx`` and ``sz``
  are fetched first, then the call happens.  So as we enter the top of
  function ``draw_rectangle``, its variable ``t`` is assigned the tess object, and ``w`` and
  ``h`` in that function are both given the value 50.

So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to create all of these
new functions. Actually, there are a lot of reasons, but this example
demonstrates two:

#. Creating a new function gives us an opportunity to name a group of
   statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation 
   behind a single command. The function (including its name) can capture our 
   mental chunking, or *abstraction*, of the problem.  
#. Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive 
   code.  

As we might expect, we have to create a function before we can execute it.
In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the
function is called.

.. index:: flow of execution

Flow of execution
-----------------

In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, we have to
know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the **flow of
execution**.   We've already talked about this a little in the previous chapter.

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program.  Statements are
executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.

Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but
remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the
function is called. Although it is not common, we can define one function
inside another. In this case, the inner definition isn't executed until the
outer function is called.

Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to
the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function,
executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left
off.

That sounds simple enough, until we remember that one function can call
another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute
the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the
program might have to execute yet another function!

Fortunately, Python is adept at keeping track of where it is, so each time a
function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that
called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.

What's the moral of this sordid tale? When we read a program, don't read from
top to bottom. Instead, follow the flow of execution.

.. index::
    single: parameter
    single: function; parameter
    single: argument
    single: function; argument
    single: import statement
    single: statement; import
    single: composition
    single: function; composition
    
Functions that require arguments
--------------------------------

Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization. 
For example, if we want to find the absolute value of a number, we have 
to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in function for 
computing the absolute value:

    .. code-block:: none
        
        >>> abs(5)
        5
        >>> abs(-5)
        5

In this example, the arguments to the ``abs`` function are 5 and -5.

Some functions take more than one argument. For example the built-in function
``pow`` takes two arguments, the base and the exponent. Inside the function,
the values that are passed get assigned to variables called **parameters**.

    .. code-block:: none
        
        >>> pow(2, 3)
        8
        >>> pow(7, 4)
        2401

Another built-in function that takes more than one argument is ``max``.

    .. code-block:: none
        
        >>> max(7, 11)
        11
        >>> max(4, 1, 17, 2, 12)
        17
        >>> max(3 * 11, 5**3, 512 - 9, 1024**0)
        503

``max`` can be passed any number of arguments, separated by commas, and will
return the largest value passed. The arguments can be either simple values or
expressions. In the last example, 503 is returned, since it is larger than 33,
125, and 1.

Functions that return values
---------------------------- 

All the functions in the previous section return values. 
Furthermore, functions like ``range``, ``int``, ``abs`` all return values that
can be used to build more complex expressions.  

So an important difference between these functions and one like ``draw_square`` is that
``draw_square`` was not executed because we wanted it to compute a value --- on the contrary,
we wrote ``draw_square`` because we wanted it to execute a sequence of steps that caused
the turtle to draw.  

A function that returns a value is called a **fruitful function** in this book.
The opposite of a fruitful function is **void function** --- one that is not executed
for its resulting value, but is executed because it does something useful. (Languages
like Java, C#, C and C++ use the term "void function", other languages like Pascal 
call it a **procedure**.) Even though void functions are not executed
for their resulting value, Python always wants to return something.  So if the programmer
doesn't arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value ``None``.

How do we write our own fruitful function?  Below is
the standard formula for compound interest, which we'll now write as a fruitful function:   

    .. image:: illustrations/compoundInterest.png

.. activecode:: compoundinterest

   def final_amt(p, r, n, t):
       """
       Apply the compound interest formula to p
       to produce the final amount.
       """
       a = p * (1 + r/n) ** (n*t)
       return a         # This is new, and makes the function fruitful.
				 
   # now that we have the function above, let us call it.  
   toInvest = float(input("How much do you want to invest?"))
   fnl = final_amt(toInvest, 0.08, 12, 5)
   print("At the end of the period you will have " + str(fnl))

* The **return** statement is followed an expression (``a`` in this case). This expression will be
  evaluated and returned to the caller as the "fruit" of calling this function.
* We prompted the user for the principal amount.  The type of ``toInvest`` is a string, but
  we need a number before we can work with it.  Because it is money, and could have decimal places,
  we've used the ``float`` type converter function to parse the string and return a float.
* Notice how we entered the arguments for 8% interest, compounded 12 times per year, for 5 years.
* When we run this, if you use 10000 as your input, you'll get the output 

      *At the end of the period you'll have 14898.457083*
 
  This is a bit messy with all these decimal places, but remember that
  Python doesn't understand that we're working with money: it just does the calculation to
  the best of its ability, without rounding.  
* The line ``toInvest = float(input("How much do you want to invest?"))``
  also shows yet another example
  of *composition* --- we can call a function like ``float``, and its arguments 
  can be the results of other function calls (like ``input``) that we've called along the way.
  
Notice something else very important here. The name of the variable we pass as an
argument --- ``toInvest`` --- has nothing to do with the name of the parameter
--- ``p``.  It is as if  ``p = toInvest`` is executed when ``final_amt`` is called. 
It doesn't matter what the value was named in 
the caller, in ``final_amt`` its name is ``p``.  
         
These short variable names are getting quite tricky, so perhaps we'd prefer one of these
versions instead:       

.. activecode:: finalamtimproves
   :norun:
   :nolinenums:

     
   def final_amt_v2(principalAmount, nominalPercentageRate, 
                        numTimesPerYear, years):
       a = principalAmount * (1 + nominalPercentageRate / 
                 numTimesPerYear) ** (numTimesPerYear*years)
       return a
	
   def final_amt_v3(amt, rate, compounded, years):
       a = amt * (1 + rate/compounded) ** (componded*years)
       return a                  

They all do the same thing.   Use your judgement to write code that can be best 
understood by other humans!  
Short variable names are more economical and sometimes make 
code easier to read: 
E = mc\ :sup:`2` would not be nearly so memorable if Einstein had
used longer variable names!  If you do prefer short names, 
make sure you also have some comments to enlighten the reader 
about what the variables are used for.
  


.. index::
    single: local variable
    single: variable; local
    single: lifetime
    
Variables and parameters are local
----------------------------------

When we create a **local variable** inside a function, it only exists inside
the function, and we cannot use it outside. For example, consider again this function:

.. activecode:: localvarexample
   :norun:
   :nolinenums:

   def final_amt(p, r, n, t):
       a = p * (1 + r/n) ** (n*t)
       return a           
 
If we try to use ``a``, outside the function, we'll get an error:

    .. code-block:: none
        
	   Traceback (most recent call last):
		 File "<pyshell#12>", line 1, in <module>
		   a
	   NameError: name 'a' is not defined
    
 
The variable ``a`` is local to ``final_amt``, and is not visible
outside the function.

Additionally, ``a`` only exists while the function is being executed --- 
we call this its **lifetime**. 
When the execution of the function terminates, 
the local variables  are destroyed. 

Parameters are also local, and act like local variables. 
For example, the lifetimes of ``p``, ``r``, ``n``, ``t`` begin when ``final_amt`` is called, 
and the lifetime ends when the function completes its execution.   

So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a 
value, complete its execution, and then when it is called again next
time, recover the local variable.  Each call of the function creates
new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns
to the caller. 
    
.. index:: refactoring code, chunking    

Turtles Revisited
-----------------

Now that we have fruitful functions, we can focus our attention on 
reorganizing our code so that it fits more nicely into our mental chunks.  
This process of rearrangement is called **refactoring** the code.  
 
Two things we're always going to want to do when working with turtles
is to create the window for the turtle, and to create one or more turtles.
For example, we could write some functions to make these tasks easier in future:

.. activecode:: turtlechunks
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   def make_window(colr, ttle):   
       """
        Set up the window with the given background color and title. 
        Returns the new window.
       """
       w = turtle.Screen()             
       w.bgcolor(colr)
       w.title(ttle)
       return w
	   
	   
   def make_turtle(colr, sz):      
       """
        Set up a turtle with the given color and pensize.
        Returns the new turtle.
       """
       t = turtle.Turtle()
       t.color(colr)
       t.pensize(sz)
       return t

Then we could make new turtles easily, like so:

.. activecode:: turtlecreates
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
	
   wn = make_window("lightgreen", "Tess and Alex dancing")
   tess = make_turtle("hotpink", 5)
   alex = make_turtle("black", 1)
   dave = make_turtle("yellow", 2)  
   
The trick about refactoring code is to anticipate which things we are likely to want to change
each time we call the function: these should become the parameters, or changeable parts,
of the functions we write.

..
    below is pasted from fruitful_functions.rst

.. index:: return statement, return value, temporary variable,
           dead code, None, unreachable code

.. index::
    single: value 
    single: variable; temporary 

Return values
-------------

The built-in functions we have used, such as ``abs``, ``pow``, ``int``, ``max``, and ``range``,
have produced results. Calling each of these functions generates a value, which
we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.

.. activecode:: buildinfuncsex
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
       
   biggest = max(3, 7, 2, 5)
   x = abs(3 - 11) + 10 

We also wrote our own function to return the final amount for a compound interest calculation.

We are going to write more functions that return values, which we
will call *fruitful functions*, for want of a better name.  The first example
is ``area``, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:

.. activecode:: areaofcircle
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   def area(radius):
       b = 3.14159 * radius**2
       return b

We have seen the ``return`` statement before: in a fruitful function the
``return`` statement includes a **return value**. This statement means: evaluate 
the return expression, and then return it immediately as the result (the fruit)
of this function.  The expression provided can be arbitrarily complicated, 
so we could have written this function like this:

.. activecode:: areaofcircle2
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   def area(radius):
       return 3.14159 * radius * radius

On the other hand, **temporary variables** like ``b`` above often make debugging
easier.

.. index:: composition, function composition

Program development
-------------------

At this point, you should be able to look at complete functions and tell what
they do. Also, you have already written some
small functions. As you write larger functions, you might start to have more
difficulty, especially with runtime and semantic errors.

To deal with increasingly complex programs, we are going to suggest a technique
called **incremental development**. The goal of incremental development is to
avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code
at a time.

As an example, suppose we want to find the distance between two points, given
by the coordinates (x\ :sub:`1`\ , y\ :sub:`1`\ ) and
(x\ :sub:`2`\ , y\ :sub:`2`\ ).  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:

    .. image:: illustrations/distance_formula.png
       :alt: Distance formula 

Don't worry if you don't know this formula or how to prove it. We're just going to worry about how to implement it in Python.

The first step is to consider what a ``distance`` function should look like in
Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output
(return value)?

In this case, the two points are the inputs, which we can represent using four
parameters. The return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value.

Already we can write an outline of the function that captures our thinking so far:

.. activecode:: distancepart1a
        
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       return 0.0

Obviously, this version of the function doesn't compute distances; it always
returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it will run, which means
that we can test it before we make it more complicated.

To test the new function, we call it with sample values:

.. activecode:: distancepart1b
        
   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       return 0.0

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))

We chose these values so that the horizontal distance equals 3 and the vertical
distance equals 4; that way, the result is 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5
triangle). When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and
we can start adding lines of code. After each incremental change, we test the
function again. If an error occurs at any point, we know where it must be --- in
the last line we added.

A logical first step in the computation is to find the differences
x\ :sub:`2`\ - x\ :sub:`1`\  and y\ :sub:`2`\ - y\ :sub:`1`\ .  We will
refer to those values using temporary variables named ``dx`` and ``dy``.

.. activecode:: distancepart2a
        
   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       dx = x2 - x1
       dy = y2 - y1
       return 0.0

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))

If we call the function with the arguments shown above, when the flow of execution
gets to the return statement, ``dx`` should be 3 and ``dy`` should be 4. 
We can check that this is the case by putting in temporary ``print`` statements in the function, like so:

.. activecode:: distancepart2b
        
   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       dx = x2 - x1
       dy = y2 - y1
       print("dx = "+str(dx))
       print("dy = "+str(dy))
       return 0.0

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))


Now we can confirm that the function is getting the right parameters and performing the first
computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check.  Once we're sure that 
``dx`` and ``dy`` are working correctly, we should remove the temporary ``print`` statements --- we don't want them in our final program.

Next we compute the sum of squares of ``dx`` and ``dy``:

.. activecode:: distancepart3a
        
   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       dx = x2 - x1
       dy = y2 - y1
       dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy
       return 0.0

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))

Again, we could put in a temporary ``print`` statement, then run the program at this stage and check the value of ``dsquared`` (which
should be 25):

.. activecode:: distancepart3b
        
   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       dx = x2 - x1
       dy = y2 - y1
       dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy
       print("dsquared = "+str(dsquared))
       return 0.0

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))


Finally, using the fractional exponent ``0.5`` to find the square root,
we compute and return the result:

.. activecode:: distancefinal
        
   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       dx = x2 - x1
       dy = y2 - y1
       dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy
       result = dsquared**0.5
       return result

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))

If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to inspect the
value of ``result`` before the return statement.

When you start out, you might add only a line or two of code at a time. As you
gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger
conceptual chunks. Either way, stepping through your code one line at a time and 
verifying that each step matches your expectations can save you a lot of
debugging time.  As you improve your programming skills you should find yourself
managing bigger and bigger chunks: this is very similar to the way we learned to read
letters, syllables, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., or the way we learn
to chunk music --- from individual notes to chords, bars, phrases, and so on.  

The key aspects of the process are:

#. Start with a working skeleton program and make small incremental changes. At any
   point, if there is an error, you will know exactly where it is.
#. Use temporary variables to refer to intermediate values so that you
   can easily inspect and check them.
#. Once the program is working, relax, sit back, and play around with your options.
   (There is interesting research that links "playfulness" to better understanding,
   better learning, more enjoyment, and a more positive mindset about 
   what you can achieve --- so spend some time fiddling around!) 
   You might want to consolidate multiple statements into one bigger compound expression,
   or rename the variables you've used, or see if you can make the function shorter. 
   A good guideline is to aim for making code as easy as possible for others to read.

Here is another version of the function.  It makes use of a square root function
that is in the ``math`` module.  Which do you
prefer?  Which looks "closer" to the Pythagorean formula we started out with?

.. activecode:: distancefancy

   import math

   def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
       return math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)

   print(distance(1,2,4,6))
     
.. index:: debugging   
   
As we saw in the example above, a powerful technique for debugging is to insert extra ``print`` functions
in carefully selected places in your code.  Then, by inspecting the output
of the program, you can check whether the algorithm is doing what you expect
it to.  Be clear about the following, however:

* You must have a clear solution to the problem, and must know what should
  happen before you can debug a program.  Work on *solving* the problem
  on a piece of paper (perhaps using a flowchart to record the steps you take)
  *before* you concern yourself with
  writing code.  Writing a program doesn't solve the problem --- it simply *automates* 
  the manual steps you would take. So first make sure you have
  a pen-and-paper manual solution that works.  
  Programming then is about making those manual steps happen automatically. 
* Do not write **chatterbox** functions.  A chatterbox is a fruitful
  function that, in addition to its primary task, also asks the user for input, 
  or prints output, when it would be more useful
  if it simply shut up and did its work quietly.  
  
  For example, we've seen built-in functions like ``range``,
  ``max`` and ``abs``.  None of these would be useful building blocks for other
  programs if they prompted the user for input, or printed their results while
  they performed their tasks.
   
  So a good tip is to avoid calling ``print`` and ``input`` functions inside 
  fruitful functions, *unless the primary purpose of your function is to
  perform input and output*.  The exception
  to this rule is to temporarily sprinkle some calls to ``print`` into
  your code to help debug and understand what is happening when the code runs,
  but these will then be removed once you get things working.


Glossary
--------

.. glossary::

    argument
        A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value
        is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.  The argument
        can be the result of an expression which may involve operators, 
        operands and calls to other fruitful functions.

    body
        The second part of a compound statement. The body consists of a
        sequence of statements all indented the same amount from the beginning
        of the header.  The standard amount of indentation used within the
        Python community is 4 spaces.

    chatterbox function
        A function which interacts with the user (using ``input`` or ``print``) when
        it should not. Silent functions that just convert their input arguments into
        their output results are usually the most useful ones.
        
    composition (of functions)
        Calling one function from within the body of another, or using the
        return value of one function as an argument to the call of another.

    compound statement
        A statement that consists of two parts:

        #. header - which begins with a keyword determining the statement
           type, and ends with a colon.
        #. body - containing one or more statements indented the same amount
           from the header.

        The syntax of a compound statement looks like this:

            .. code-block:: none
            
                keyword ... :
                    statement
                    statement ...
                                               
    dead code
        Part of a program that can never be executed, often because it appears
        after a ``return`` statement.

    docstring
        A special string that is attached to a function as its ``__doc__`` attribute.
        Tools like IDLE can use docstrings to provide documentation or hints for the programmer.
        When we get to modules, classes, and methods, we'll see that docstrings can also be used there. 

    flow of execution
        The order in which statements are executed during a program run.

    fruitful function
        A function that yields a return value instead of ``None``.

    function
        A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.
        Functions may or may not take parameters and may or may not produce a
        result.

    function call
        A statement that executes a function. It consists of the name of the
        function followed by a list of arguments enclosed in parentheses.

    function composition
        Using the output from one function call as the input to another.

    function definition
        A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name,
        parameters, and the statements it executes.
        
    fruitful function
        A function that returns a value when it is called.

    header line
        The first part of a compound statement. A header line begins with a keyword and
        ends with a colon (:)

    import statement
        A statement which permits functions and variables defined in another Python
        module to be brought into the environment of another script.  To use the 
        features of the turtle, we need to first import the turtle module.
        
    incremental development
        A program development plan intended to simplify debugging by adding and
        testing only a small amount of code at a time.

    lifetime
        Variables and objects have lifetimes --- they are created at some point during
        program execution, and will be destroyed at some time. 
        
    local variable
        A variable defined inside a function. A local variable can only be used
        inside its function.  Parameters of a function are also a special kind
        of local variable.

    None
        A special Python value. One use in Python is that it is returned 
        by functions that do not execute a return statement with a return argument. 

    parameter
        A name used inside a function to refer to the value which was passed 
        to it as an argument.
           
    refactor
        A fancy word to describe reorganizing our program code, usually to make 
        it more understandable.  Typically, we have a program that is already working,
        then we go back to "tidy it up".  It often involves choosing better variable
        names, or spotting repeated patterns and moving that code into a function.    
        
    return value
        The value provided as the result of a function call.

    scaffolding
        Code that is used during program development to assist with development
        and debugging. The unit test code that we added in this chapter are
        examples of scaffolding.
        
    temporary variable
        A variable used to store an intermediate value in a complex
        calculation.
        
    test suite
        A collection of tests for some code you have written.

    traceback
        A list of the functions that are executing, printed when a runtime
        error occurs. A traceback is also commonly refered to as a
        *stack trace*, since it lists the functions in the order in which they
        are stored in the
        `runtime stack <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_stack>`__.
        
    unit testing
        An automatic procedure used to validate that individual units of code
        are working properly.  Having a test suite is extremely useful when somebody
        modifies or extends the code: it provides a safety net against 
        going backwards by putting new bugs into previously working code.  
        The term *regression* testing is often used to capture this idea that we
        don't want to go backwards!         
               
    void function
        The opposite of a fruitful function: one that does not return a value.  It is
        executed for the work it does, rather than for the value it returns.
