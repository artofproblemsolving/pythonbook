Conditionals
============

Programs get really interesting when we can test conditions and change the 
program behavior depending on the outcome of the tests.  That's what this
chapter is about.

Boolean values and expressions
------------------------------

A *Boolean* value is either true or false.  It is named
after the British mathematician, George Boole, who first formulated *Boolean
algebra* --- some rules for reasoning about and combining these values.
This is the basis of all modern computer logic.

In Python, the two Boolean values are ``True`` and ``False`` (the
capitalization must be exactly as shown), and the Python type is **bool**.

    .. code-block:: none
        
       >>> type(True)
       <class 'bool'> 
       >>> type(true)
       Traceback (most recent call last):
         File "<pyshell#3>", line 1, in <module>
           type(true)
       NameError: name 'true' is not defined

A **Boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is
a Boolean value.  For example, the operator ``==`` tests if two values are equal.  
It produces (or *yields*) a Boolean value:

    .. code-block:: none   
     
	   >>> 5 == (3 + 2)   # Is five equal 5 to the result of 3 + 2? 
	   True
	   >>> 5 == 6
	   False
	   >>> j = "hel"
	   >>> j + "lo" == "hello"
	   True

In the first statement, the two operands evaluate to equal values, so the expression evaluates
to ``True``; in the second statement, 5 is not equal to 6, so we get ``False``.

The ``==`` operator is one of six common **comparison operators** which all produce 
a ``bool`` result; here are all six:

    .. code-block:: none        

	   x == y               # Produce True if ... x is equal to y
	   x != y               #                 ... x is not equal to y
	   x > y                #                 ... x is greater than y
	   x < y                #                 ... x is less than y
	   x >= y               #                 ... x is greater than or equal to y
	   x <= y               #                 ... x is less than or equal to y
 
Although these operations are probably familiar, the Python symbols are
different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single
equal sign (``=``) instead of a double equal sign (``==``). Remember that ``=``
is an assignment operator and ``==`` is a comparison operator. Also, there is
no such thing as ``=<`` or ``=>``.

Like any other types we've seen so far, Boolean values can be assigned to 
variables, printed, etc.

.. activecode:: booleanexample

   age = 18
   oldEnoughToGetDriversLicense = age >= 16
   print(oldEnoughToGetDriversLicense)

Logical operators
-----------------

There are three **logical operators**,  ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``,
that allow us to build more complex
Boolean expressions from simpler Boolean expressions. The
semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English.
For example, ``x > 0 and x < 10`` produces ``True`` only if ``x`` is greater than 0 *and*
at the same time, x is less than 10.

``n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0`` is ``True`` if *either* of the conditions is ``True``,
that is, if the number ``n`` is divisible by 2 *or* it is divisible by 3.  What do
you think happens if ``n`` is divisible by both 2 and by 3 at the same time?
Will the expression yield ``True`` or ``False``?  Let's try it:

.. activecode:: ortest

   n = 6
   print(n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0)

Finally, the ``not`` operator negates a Boolean value, so ``not (x > y)``
is ``True`` if ``(x > y)`` is ``False``, that is, if ``x`` is less than or equal to
``y``.

The expression on the left of the ``or`` operator is evaluated first: if the result is ``True``, 
Python does not (and need not) evaluate the expression on the right --- this is called *short-circuit evaluation*.
Similarly, for the ``and`` operator, if the expression on the left yields ``False``, Python does not
evaluate the expression on the right.   In this way, there are no unnecessary evaluations.

Truth Tables
------------

A truth table is a small table that allows us to list all the possible inputs,
and to give the results for the logical operators.  Because the ``and`` and ``or``
operators each have two operands, there are only four rows in a truth table that
describes the semantics of ``and``.


  ======= =======  ========
  a       b        a and b
  ======= =======  ========
  False   False    False
  False   True     False
  True    False    False
  True    True     True
  ======= =======  ========

In a Truth Table, we sometimes use T and F as shorthand for the two 
Boolean values: here is the truth table describing ``or``:

  ===  ===  =======
  a    b    a or b
  ===  ===  =======
  F    F    F
  F    T    T
  T    F    T
  T    T    T
  ===  ===  =======

The third logical operator, ``not``, only takes a single operand, so its truth table
only has two rows:

  ===  ======
  a    not a
  ===  ======
  F    T
  T    F
  ===  ======

Conditional execution
---------------------

In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check
conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. **Conditional
statements** give us this ability. The simplest form is the **if**
statement:

.. activecode:: parityexample
   
   x = 8
     
   if x % 2 == 0:
       print(str(x)+" is even.")
       print("Did you know that 2 is the only even number that is prime?")
   else:
       print(str(x)+" is odd.") 
       print("Did you know that multiplying two odd numbers " + 
   				"always gives an odd result?")
    
Try changing the value of ``x`` in the above program, and see how the output changes.

The Boolean expression after the ``if`` statement is called the **condition**.
If it is true, then all the indented statements get executed. If not, then all
the statements indented under the ``else`` clause get executed. 

.. admonition::  Flowchart of an if statement with an else clause

   .. image:: illustrations/flowchart_if_else.png  

The syntax for an ``if`` statement looks like this:

.. activecode:: booleanflowchart
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
       STATEMENTS_1        # Executed if condition evaluates to True
   else:
       STATEMENTS_2        # Executed if condition evaluates to False

As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound
statements like ``for``, the ``if`` statement consists of a header line and a body. The header
line begins with the keyword ``if`` followed by a *Boolean expression* and ends with
a colon (:).

The indented statements that follow are called a **block**. The first
unindented statement marks the end of the block. 

Each of the statements inside the first block of statements are executed in order if the Boolean
expression evaluates to ``True``. The entire first block of statements 
is skipped if the Boolean expression evaluates to ``False``, and instead
all the statements indented under the ``else`` clause are executed. 

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of an
``if`` statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.  Occasionally, it is useful
to have a section with no statements (usually as a place keeper, or scaffolding, 
for code we haven't written yet). In that case, we can use the ``pass`` statement, which
does nothing except act as a placeholder.

.. activecode:: ifelsewithpasses 
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
       
   if True:          # This is always True,
       pass          #   so this is always executed, but it does nothing
   else:
       pass 


.. index:: alternative execution, branch, wrapping code in a function

Omitting the ``else`` clause
----------------------------

.. admonition::  Flowchart of an if statement with no else clause

   .. image:: illustrations/flowchart_if_only.png

Another form of the ``if`` statement is one in which the ``else`` clause is omitted entirely.  
In this case, when the condition evaluates to ``True``, the statements are
executed, otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the ``if``.

.. activecode:: squarerootexample

   x = 36
   if x < 0:
       print("The negative number "+str(x)+" is not valid here.")
       x = 42
       print("I've decided to use the number 42 instead.")
   print("The square root of "+str(x)+" is "+str(x**0.5))
    
In this case, the print function that outputs the square root is the one after the ``if`` block.  As the code is originally written, the condition of the ``if`` statement is ``False``, so the block of code inside the ``if`` block gets skipped. Change the value of ``x`` to something negative and run it again to see the difference.

.. admonition:: Python terminology
    
    Python documentation sometimes uses the term **suite** of statements to mean what we
    have called a *block* here. They mean the same thing, and since most other languages and
    computer scientists use the word *block*, we'll stick with that.
    
    Notice too that ``else`` is not a statement.  The ``if`` statement has 
    two *clauses*, one of which is the (optional) ``else`` clause.
      
        
.. index::
    single: chained conditional 
    single: conditional; chained

Chained conditionals
--------------------

Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two
branches. One way to express a computation like that is a **chained
conditional**:
   
.. activecode:: ifelifelseflowchart
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if x < y:
       STATEMENTS_A
   elif x > y:
       STATEMENTS_B
   else:
       STATEMENTS_C

.. admonition:: Flowchart of this chained conditional 
 
    .. image:: illustrations/flowchart_chained_conditional.png        
        
``elif`` is an abbreviation of ``else if``. Again, exactly one branch will be
executed. There is no limit of the number of ``elif`` statements but only a
single (and optional) final ``else`` statement is allowed and it must be the last
branch in the statement:

.. activecode:: ifelifelifelseflowchart
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if choice == "a":
       function_one()
   elif choice == "b":
       function_two()
   elif choice == "c":
       function_three()
   else:
       print("Invalid choice.")

Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked,
and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the
statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true
branch executes.


.. index::
    single: nested conditionals
    single: conditionals; nested

Nested conditionals
-------------------

One conditional can also be **nested** within another. (It is the same theme of
composability, again!)  We could have written
the previous example as follows:

.. admonition:: Flowchart of this nested conditional

   .. image:: illustrations/flowchart_nested_conditional.png

.. activecode:: ififelseflowchart
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if x < y:
       STATEMENTS_A
   else:
       if x > y:
           STATEMENTS_B
       else:
           STATEMENTS_C

The outer conditional contains two branches. 
The second branch contains another ``if`` statement, which
has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain
conditional statements as well.

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested
conditionals very quickly become difficult to read.  In general, it is a good
idea to avoid them when we can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional
statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a single
conditional:

.. activecode:: multicondbad
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if 0 < x:            # Assume x is an int here
       if x < 10:
           print("x is a positive single digit.")

The ``print`` function is called only if we make it past both the
conditionals, so instead of the above which uses two ``if`` statements each with
a simple condition, we could make a more complex condition using the ``and`` operator.  Now we only
need a single ``if`` statement:

.. activecode:: multicondgood
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if 0 < x and x < 10: # Assume x is an int here
       print("x is a positive single digit.")

          
            

.. index::
    single: return statement
    single: statement; return

The ``return`` statement
------------------------

The ``return`` statement, with or without a value, depending on whether the 
function is fruitful or void, allows us to terminate the execution of a function
before (or when) we reach the end. One reason to use an *early return* is if we detect an error
condition:

.. activecode:: squarerootwithcheck
        
   def print_square_root(x):
       if x <= 0:
           print("Positive numbers only, please.")
           return
       result = x**0.5
       print("The square root of "+str(x)+" is "+str(result))

   print_square_root(16)
   print_square_root(-4)

The function ``print_square_root`` has a parameter named ``x``. The first thing
it does is check whether ``x`` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it
displays an error message and then uses ``return`` to exit the function. The
flow of execution immediately returns to the caller, and the remaining lines of
the function are not executed.


                 
Logical opposites
-----------------

Each of the six relational operators has a logical opposite: for example,
suppose we can get a driver's licence when our age is greater or equal to 16,
we can *not* get the driver's licence when we are less than 16.

Notice that the opposite of ``>=`` is ``<``.  

  ========  ================
  operator  logical opposite     
  ========  ================
  ==        !=
  !=        ==
  <         >=
  <=        >
  >         <=
  >=        <
  ========  ================
  
Understanding these logical opposites allows us to sometimes get rid of ``not``
operators.  ``not`` operators are often quite difficult to read in computer code, and
our intentions will usually be clearer if we can eliminate them. 

For example, if we wrote this Python:

.. activecode:: licensebad
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if not (age >= 17):
       print("Hey, you are too young to get a driver's licence!")
          
it would probably be clearer to use the simplification laws, and to 
write instead:

.. activecode:: licensegood
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if age < 17:
       print("Hey, you are too young to get a driver's licence!")

Two powerful simplification laws (called de Morgan's laws) that are often
helpful when dealing with complicated Boolean expressions are:

    .. code-block:: none
    
       not (x and y)  ==  (not x) or (not y) 
       not (x or y)   ==  (not x) and (not y)
          
For example, suppose we can slay the dragon only if our magic 
lightsabre sword is charged to 90% or higher, 
and we have 100 or more energy units in our protective shield.  
We find this fragment of Python code in the game:

.. activecode:: dragonbad
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   if not ((sword_charge >= 0.90) and (shield_energy >= 100)):
       print("Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!")
   else:
       print("The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the princess!")

de Morgan's laws together with the logical opposites would let us
rework the condition in a (perhaps) easier to understand way like this:

.. activecode:: dragonbetter
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   if (sword_charge < 0.90) or (shield_energy < 100):
       print("Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!")
   else:
       print("The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the princess!")


We could also get rid of the ``not`` by swapping around the ``then`` and
``else`` parts of the conditional.  So here is a third version, also equivalent:

.. activecode:: dragonbest
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   if (sword_charge >= 0.90) and (shield_energy >= 100):
       print("The dragon crumples in a heap. You rescue the princess!")
   else:
       print("Your attack has no effect, the dragon fries you to a crisp!")
 
This version is probably the best of the three, because it very closely matches  
the initial English statement. Clarity of our code (for other humans), 
and making it easy to see that the code does what was expected should always
be a high priority.  

As our programming skills develop we'll find we have 
more than one way to solve any problem.  So good programs are *designed*. 
We make choices that favour clarity, simplicity, and elegance.  The job 
title *software architect* says a lot about what we do --- we are *architects*
who engineer our products to balance beauty, functionality, simplicity and 
clarity in our creations.  

.. tip::

    Once our program works, we should play around a bit trying to polish it up.
    Write good comments.  Think about whether the code would be clearer with 
    different variable names.  Could we have done it more elegantly?  Should
    we rather use a function?  Can we simplify the conditionals? 
    
    We think of our code as our creation, our work of art!  We make it great.

.. index::
    single: type conversion
    single: type; conversion

Type conversion
---------------

We've had a first look at this in an earlier chapter.  Seeing it again won't hurt! 

Many Python types come with a built-in function that attempts to convert values
of another type into its own type. The ``int`` function, for example,
takes any value and converts it to an integer, if possible, or complains
otherwise:

    .. code-block:: none
        
       >>> int("32")
       32
       >>> int("Hello")
       Traceback (most recent call last):
         File "<pyshell#6>", line 1, in <module>
           int("hello")
       ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'

``int`` can also convert floating-point values to integers, but remember
that it truncates the fractional part:

    .. code-block:: none
     
       >>> int(-2.3)
       -2
       >>> int(3.99999)
       3
       >>> int("42")
       42
       >>> int(1.0)
       1

The ``float`` function converts integers and strings to floating-point
numbers:

    .. code-block:: none
        
       >>> float(32)
       32.0
       >>> float("3.14159")
       3.14159
       >>> float(1)
       1.0

It may seem odd that Python distinguishes the integer value ``1`` from the
floating-point value ``1.0``. They may represent the same number, but they
belong to different types. The reason is that they are represented differently
inside the computer.

The ``str`` function converts any argument given to it to type
``string``:

    .. code-block:: none 
       
       >>> str(32)
       '32'
       >>> str(3.14149)
       '3.14149'
       >>> str(True)
       'True'
       >>> str(true)
       Traceback (most recent call last):
         File "<pyshell#7>", line 1, in <module>
           str(true)
       NameError: name 'true' is not defined

``str`` will work with any value and convert it into a string.  As
mentioned earlier, ``True`` is Boolean value; ``true`` is just an ordinary variable name,
and is not defined here, so we get an error.

.. index:: Boolean function

Boolean functions
-----------------

Functions can return Boolean values, which is often convenient for hiding
complicated tests inside functions. For example:

.. activecode:: booleanfunction

   def is_divisible(x, y):
       """ Test if x is exactly divisible by y """
       if x % y == 0:
           return True 
       else:
           return False 

   print(is_divisible(10,5))  # should print True
   print(is_divisible(10,7))  # should print False

It is common to give **Boolean
functions** names that sound like yes/no questions.  ``is_divisible`` returns
either ``True`` or ``False`` to indicate whether the ``x`` is or is not
divisible by ``y``.

We can make the function more concise by taking advantage of the fact that the
condition of the ``if`` statement is itself a Boolean expression. We can return
it directly, avoiding the ``if`` statement altogether:

.. activecode:: booleanfunctionbetter

   def is_divisible(x, y):
       """ Test if x is exactly divisible by y """
       return x % y == 0

   print(is_divisible(10,5))  # should print True
   print(is_divisible(10,7))  # should print False


Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

.. activecode:: booleanfunctionexample
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if is_divisible(x, y):
       ... # Do something ...
   else:
       ... # Do something else ...

It might be tempting to write something like:

.. activecode:: booleanfunctionbadidea
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   if is_divisible(x, y) == True:

but the extra comparison is unnecessary.

    wrapping code in a function
        The process of adding a function header and parameters to a sequence
        of program statements is often refered to as "wrapping the code in
        a function".  This process is very useful whenever the program
        statements in question are going to be used multiple times.  It is
        even more useful when it allows the programmer to express their mental
        chunking, and how they've broken a complex problem into pieces.
