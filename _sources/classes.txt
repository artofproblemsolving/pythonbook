Classes and Objects --- the Basics
==================================

.. index:: object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming
---------------------------

Python is an **object-oriented programming language**, which means that it
provides features that support `object-oriented programming
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`__ (**OOP**).

Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn't until the
mid 1980s that it became the main `programming paradigm
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm>`__ used in the creation
of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing
size and complexity of software systems, and to make it easier to modify these
large and complex systems over time.

Up to now, most of the programs we have been writing use a `procedural programming
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming>`__ paradigm. In
procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or *procedures* which
operate on data. In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of
**objects** which contain both data and functionality together.   (We have seen turtle
objects, string objects, and random number generators, to name a few places where
we've already worked with objects.) 

Usually, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real
world, and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways
real-world objects interact.
 
.. index:: compound data type

User-defined compound data types
--------------------------------

We've already seen classes like ``str``, ``int``, ``float`` and ``Turtle``.  
We are now ready to create our own user-defined class: the ``Point``.

Consider the concept of a mathematical point. In two dimensions, a point is two
numbers (coordinates) that are treated collectively as a single object. 
Points are often written in parentheses with a comma
separating the coordinates. For example, ``(0, 0)`` represents the origin, and
``(x, y)`` represents the point ``x`` units to the right and ``y`` units up
from the origin.

Some of the typical operations that one associates with points might be
calculating the distance of a point from the origin, or from another point,
or finding a midpoint of two points, or asking if a point falls within a
given rectangle or circle.  We'll shortly see how we can organize these
together with the data.

A natural way to represent a point in Python is with two numeric values. The
question, then, is how to group these two values into a compound object. The
quick and dirty solution is to use a tuple, and for some applications
that might be a good choice.

An alternative is to define a new **class**. This approach involves a 
bit more effort, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon.  
We'll want our points to each have an ``x`` and a ``y`` attribute,
so our first class definition looks like this:

.. activecode:: pointdef
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = 0
           self.y = 0          

Class definitions can appear anywhere in a program, but they are usually near
the beginning (after the ``import`` statements). Some programmers and languages
prefer to put every class in a module of its own --- we won't do that here.  
The syntax rules for a class
definition are the same as for other compound statements. There is a header
which begins with the keyword, ``class``, followed by the name of the class,
and ending with a colon.  Indentation levels tell us where the class ends.

If the first line after the class header is a string, it becomes
the docstring of the class, and will be recognized by various tools.  (This
is also the way docstrings work in functions.)

Every class should have a method with the special name ``__init__``.  
This **initializer method** is automatically called whenever a new 
instance of ``Point`` is created.  It gives the programmer the opportunity 
to set up the attributes required within the new instance by giving them 
their initial state/values.  The ``self`` parameter (we could choose any
other name, but ``self`` is the convention) is automatically set to reference
the newly created object that needs to be initialized.   

So let's use our new ``Point`` class now:

.. activecode:: pointcreate
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = 0
           self.y = 0          

   p = Point()         # Instantiate an object of type Point
   q = Point()         # Make a second point

   print(p.x, p.y, q.x, q.y)  # Each point object has its own x and y
    
This program prints: 

    .. sourcecode:: python3
    
       0 0 0 0
   
because during the initialization of the objects, we created two
attributes called ``x`` and ``y`` for each, and gave them both the value 0.

This should look familiar --- we've used classes before to create
more than one object:   

.. activecode:: turtleanalogy
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   from turtle import Turtle    
        
   tess = Turtle()     # Instantiate objects of type Turtle   
   alex = Turtle()  
 
The variables ``p`` and ``q`` are assigned references to two new ``Point`` objects. 
A function like ``Turtle`` or ``Point`` that creates a new object instance 
is called a **constructor**, and every class automatically provides a
constructor function which is named the same as the class.

It may be helpful to think of a class as a *factory* for making objects.  
The class itself isn't an instance of a point, but it contains the machinery 
to make point instances.   Every time we call the constructor, we're asking
the factory to make us a new object.  As the object comes off the 
production line, its initialization method is executed to 
get the object properly set up with its factory default settings.

The combined process of "make me a new object" and "get its settings initialized
to the factory default settings" is called **instantiation**.  

.. index:: attribute

Attributes
----------

Like real world objects, object instances have both attributes and methods.   

We can modify the attributes in an instance using dot notation:

.. activecode:: pointmodify
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = 0
           self.y = 0          

   p = Point()         # Instantiate an object of type Point
   q = Point()         # Make a second point

   # change attributes of p
   p.x = 3
   p.y = 4

   print(p.x, p.y, q.x, q.y)  # Each point object has its own x and y
        

Both modules and instances create
their own namespaces, and the syntax for accessing names contained in each,
called **attributes**, is the same. In this case the attribute we are selecting
is a data item from an instance.

The following state diagram shows the result of these assignments:

    .. image:: illustrations/point.png
       :alt: Point state diagram 

The variable ``p`` refers to a ``Point`` object, which contains two attributes.
Each attribute refers to a number.

We can access the value of an attribute using the same syntax:

.. activecode:: pointattr
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = 0
           self.y = 0          

   p = Point()         # Instantiate an object of type Point
   q = Point()         # Make a second point

   # change attributes of p
   p.x = 3
   p.y = 4

   x = p.x
   print(x)

The expression ``p.x`` means, "Go to the object ``p`` refers to and get the
value of ``x``". In this case, we assign that value to a variable named ``x``.
There is no conflict between the variable ``x`` (in the global namespace here)
and the attribute ``x`` (in the namespace belonging to the instance). The
purpose of dot notation is to fully qualify which variable we are referring to
unambiguously.

We can use dot notation as part of any expression, so the following statements
are legal:

.. activecode:: pointuseattr
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = 0
           self.y = 0          

   p = Point()         # Instantiate an object of type Point
   q = Point()         # Make a second point

   # change attributes of p
   p.x = 3
   p.y = 4

   print("(x="+str(p.x)+", y="+str(p.y)+")")
   distanceSquaredFromOrigin = p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y
   print(distanceSquaredFromOrigin)


Improving our initializer
------------------------- 

To create a point at position (7, 6) currently needs three lines of code:

.. activecode:: pointinitbad
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   p = Point()
   p.x = 7
   p.y = 6
    
We can make our class constructor more general by placing extra parameters into
the ``__init__`` method, as shown in this example:

.. activecode:: pointinitimproved
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          
                
   # Other statements outside the class continue below here.

The ``x`` and ``y`` parameters here are both optional.  If the caller does not 
supply arguments, they'll get the default values of 0.  Here is our improved class 
in action:

.. activecode:: pointinitexample
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

   p = Point(4, 2)
   q = Point(6, 3)
   r = Point()       # r represents the origin (0, 0)
   print(p.x, q.y, r.x)  # should print 4 3 0
    
       
Adding other methods to our class
---------------------------------
          
The key advantage of using a class like ``Point`` rather than a simple
tuple ``(6, 7)`` now becomes apparent.  We can add methods to
the ``Point`` class that are sensible operations for points, but
which may not be appropriate for other tuples like ``(25, 12)`` which might
represent, say, a day and a month, e.g. Christmas day. So being able
to calculate the distance from the origin is sensible for 
points, but not for (day, month) data.  For (day, month) data, 
we'd like different operations, perhaps to find what day of the week 
it will fall on in 2020.
 
Creating a class like ``Point`` brings an exceptional
amount of "organizational power" to our programs, and to our thinking. 
We can group together the sensible operations, and the kinds of data 
they apply to, and each instance of the class can have its own state.       
          
A **method** behaves like a function but it is invoked on a specific
instance, e.g. ``tess.right(90)``.   Like a data
attribute, methods are accessed using dot notation.  

Let's add another method, ``distance_from_origin``, to see better how methods
work:

.. activecode:: pointmethod
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

   p = Point(3, 4)
   q = Point(5, 12)
   r = Point()       # r represents the origin (0, 0)

   print(p.distance_from_origin())  # should be 5
   print(q.distance_from_origin())  # should be 13
   print(r.distance_from_origin())  # should be 0
   
When defining a method, the first parameter refers to the instance being
manipulated.  As already noted, it is customary to name this parameter ``self``.  

Notice that the caller of ``distance_from_origin`` does not explicitly 
supply an argument to match the ``self`` parameter --- this is done for
us, behind our back.  

    
Instances as arguments and parameters
-------------------------------------

We can pass an object as an argument in the usual way. We've already seen
this in some of the turtle examples, where we passed the turtle to
some function like ``draw_bar`` in the chapter titled `Conditionals`, 
so that the function could control and use whatever turtle instance we passed to it.  

Be aware that our variable only holds a reference to an object, so passing ``tess``
into a function creates an alias: both the caller and the called function
now have a reference, but there is only one turtle! 

Here is a simple function involving our new ``Point`` objects:
 
.. activecode:: printpointfunc
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

   def print_point(pt):
       print("("+str(pt.x)+","+str(pt.y)+")")

   p = Point(3, 4)
   print_point(p)


Converting an instance to a string
----------------------------------

Most object-oriented programmers probably would not do what we've just done in ``print_point``.  
When we're working with classes and objects, a preferred alternative
is to add a new method to the class.  And we don't like chatterbox methods that call
``print``.  A better approach is to have a method so that every instance
can produce a string representation of itself.  Let's initially 
call it ``to_string``:

.. activecode:: printpointmethod
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

       def to_string(self):
           return "("+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+")"

   p = Point(3, 4)
   print(p.to_string())
    
But don't we already have a ``str`` type converter that can 
turn our object into a string?  Yes!  And doesn't ``print``
automatically use this when printing things?  Yes again! 
But these automatic mechanisms do not yet do exactly what we want: 

.. activecode:: printobjdirectly
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

       def to_string(self):
           return "("+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+")"

   p = Point(3, 4)
   print(str(p))
   print(p)
   
Python has a clever trick up its sleeve to fix this.  If we call our new 
method ``__str__`` instead of ``to_string``, the Python interpreter
will use our code whenever it needs to convert a ``Point`` to a string.  
Let's re-do this again, now:

.. activecode:: pointstrmethod
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

       def __str__(self):
           return "("+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+")"

   p = Point(3, 4)
   print(str(p))
   print(p)
              

Instances as return values
--------------------------

Functions and methods can return instances. For example, given two ``Point`` objects,
find their midpoint.  First we'll write this as a regular function. The function creates and returns a new ``Point`` object:


.. activecode:: pointsmpfunc
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

       def __str__(self):
           return "("+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+")"

   def midpoint(p1, p2):
       """ Return the midpoint of points p1 and p2 """        
       mx = (p1.x + p2.x)/2
       my = (p1.y + p2.y)/2
       return Point(mx, my)

   p = Point(3, 4)
   q = Point(5, 12)
   r = midpoint(p, q)
   print(r)

    
Now let us do this as a method instead.  Suppose we have a point object,
and wish to find the midpoint halfway between it and some other target point. This method is identical to the function, aside from some renaming.


.. activecode:: pointsmpmeth
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

       def __str__(self):
           return "("+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+")"

       def halfway(self, target):
           """ Return the halfway point between myself and the target """        
           mx = (self.x + target.x)/2
           my = (self.y + target.y)/2
           return Point(mx, my)

   p = Point(3, 4)
   q = Point(5, 12)
   r = p.halfway(q)
   print(r)

While this example assigns each point to a variable, this need not be done.
Just as function calls are composable, method calls and object instantiation
are also composable, leading to this alternative that uses no variables:

.. activecode:: pointsmpnovars
        
   class Point:
       """ Point class represents and manipulates x,y coords. """
            
       def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
           """ Create a new point at the origin """
           self.x = x
           self.y = y          

       def distance_from_origin(self):
           """ Compute my distance from the origin """
           return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5 

       def __str__(self):
           return "("+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+")"

       def halfway(self, target):
           """ Return the halfway point between myself and the target """        
           mx = (self.x + target.x)/2
           my = (self.y + target.y)/2
           return Point(mx, my)

   print(Point(3, 4).halfway(Point(5, 12)))

    
A change of perspective
-----------------------

The original syntax for a function call, ``print_time(current_time)``, suggests that the
function is the active agent. It says something like, *"Hey, print_time!  
Here's an object for you to print."*

In object-oriented programming, the objects are considered the active agents. An
invocation like ``current_time.print_time()`` says *"Hey current_time!
Please print yourself!"*

In our early introduction to turtles, we used
an object-oriented style, so that we said ``tess.forward(100)``, which 
asks the turtle to move itself forward by the given number of steps.

This change in perspective might be more polite, but it may not initially
be obvious that it is useful. But sometimes shifting responsibility from 
the functions onto the objects makes it possible to write more versatile 
functions, and makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.  

The most important advantage of the object-oriented style is that it
fits our mental chunking and real-life experience more accurately. 
In real life our ``cook`` method is part of our microwave oven --- we don't
have a ``cook`` function sitting in the corner of the kitchen, into which
we pass the microwave!  Similarly, we use the cellphone's own methods 
to send an sms, or to change its state to silent.  The functionality 
of real-world objects tends to be tightly bound up inside the objects 
themselves.  OOP allows us to accurately mirror this when we
organize our programs. 

Objects can have state
----------------------

Objects are most useful when we also need to keep some state that is updated from 
time to time.  Consider a turtle object.  Its state consists of things like
its position, its heading, its color, and its shape.  A method like ``left(90)`` updates
the turtle's heading, ``forward`` changes its position, and so on.

For a bank account object, a main component of the state would be
the current balance, and perhaps a log of all transactions.  The methods would
allow us to query the current balance, deposit new funds, or make a payment.
Making a payment would include an amount, and a description, so that this could
be added to the transaction log.  We'd also want a method to show the transaction
log.

Glossary

    class
        A user-defined compound type. A class can also be thought of as a
        template for the objects that are instances of it. (The iPhone is

        Every class has a "factory", called by the same name as the class, for
        making new instances.  If the class has an *initializer method*, this method
        is used to get the attributes (i.e. the state) of the new object properly set up. 
            
    initializer method
        A special method in Python (called ``__init__``) 
        that is invoked automatically to set a newly created object's
        attributes to their initial (factory-default) state.
        
    instance
        An object whose type is of some class.  Instance and object are used
        interchangeably.
        
    instantiate
        To create an instance of a class, and to run its initializer. 
        
    method
        A function that is defined inside a class definition and is invoked on
        instances of that class. 

    object
        A compound data type that is often used to model a thing or concept in
        the real world.  It bundles together the data and the operations that 
        are relevant for that kind of data.  Instance and object are used
        interchangeably.

    object-oriented programming
        A powerful style of programming in which data and the operations 
        that manipulate it are organized into objects.        

    object-oriented language
        A language that provides features, such as user-defined classes and
        inheritance, that facilitate object-oriented programming.
